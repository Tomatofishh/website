**Due on Gradescope at 11:59 pm Sunday 6/27**

The first problem set is a pair of surveys. The *Welcome Survey* acquaints you with the course syllabus and helps us learn your background. These responses will be read by I and the GSIs and not shared publicly. 

The *Data Collection* will be used to generate a data set that we will use throughout the course. Please assume that any answers entered into the Data Collection survey will be public.

Upon completing the survey, please visit Problem Set 1 on Gradescope and answer one question that references the surveys.
