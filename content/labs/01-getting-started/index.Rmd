# Learning Objectives

1. Explain what the evidence shows regarding learning outcomes of active versus lecture-based learning.
2. 
3. Carry out the protocol of at least one active learning strategy in your own classroom.

# Preparation

Read this [Washington Post article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/07/11/it-puts-kids-to-sleep-but-teachers-keep-lecturing-anyway-heres-what-to-do-about-it/) and post a follow-up comment on the class forum. Here are some guiding questions:

- Do you agree with the sentiment of this piece? Have you ever been in a class where lecture was completely ineffective?
- Can you offer a counterexampleâ€”are there situations where lecture is actually valuable and effective?
- Have you ever been in a class that is not lecture-based? What are some strategies you might suggest for successful alternative teaching strategies?
