<h1>Preparation</h1>
<p>Read this <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/07/11/it-puts-kids-to-sleep-but-teachers-keep-lecturing-anyway-heres-what-to-do-about-it/">Washington Post article</a> and post a follow-up comment on the class forum. Here are some guiding questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you agree with the sentiment of this piece? Have you ever been in a class where lecture was completely ineffective?</li>
<li>Can you offer a counterexampleâ€”are there situations where lecture is actually valuable and effective?</li>
<li>Have you ever been in a class that is not lecture-based? What are some strategies you might suggest for successful alternative teaching strategies?</li>
</ul>
